# MossPhylo
Moss phylotranscriptomic analysis codes for my graduate research under Dr. Matt Johnson at Texas Tech Biological Sciences (https://github.com/mossmatters).

Analysis of transcriptome (Illumina HiSeq NGS) files for ~90 new plerocarpous (creeping) mosses is ongoing, with the goal to update previously published research regarding species diversity in the second largest group of plants. 

Files cover the different steps of the process, including trimming, translation, de novo assembly, clustering, multiple sequence alignment, orthologous group discovery and tree creation. Helper files for other sub-steps are also included for transparency. Python and bash are used in the majority of the files, with several one-off command line steps utilizing sed and awk shown for completeness.
